How to run the components of the project

eclipse project > RPG

Training Component
To Train A Model Using Full Space Enumeration
	1_run file > run.RunML.java
		this creates data csv files with risk, desirability, distances, landmark features for 20 intervention problems
	2 run file > mlpreprocess.Preprocessor.java
		this creates the training data csv that collects all  data csv files created in step 1 and creates 1 big csv file 
		convert this csv as a arff file using weka
		train the models
		
Testing and Evaluation Component
To Test The Trained Model Using Full Space Enumeration
	1_run file > run.RunML.java
		this creates data csv files with risk, desirability, distances, landmark features for 20 intervention problems
	2 run file > mlpreprocess.Preprocessor.java
		this creates the training data csv that collects all  data csv files created in step 1 and creates 1 big csv file 
		the produced file is called instfull.csv
		convert this csv as a arff file using weka
	3 run file > predictor.Preprocess.java
		the program reads file instfull.arff and tk_instfull.arff and produces file called inst(full/tk)pred.arff with Y/N replaced with ?
		feed this into weka as supplied input and get predictions. 
		copy weka output to the prediction-featureset-classifier.csv files for each classifier and topk or full space featuresets
	4 run file > predictor.AccuracyCalculator.java
		produces the file with precision, recall, f1 values for each prediction file.
	5 repeat 1--4 for the three test instances.


repeat for top-k
repeat for ramirez
